    Returns a numpy array of spike times for a single cluster 
        within a window locked to a sampling time.
    
    Parameters
    ------
    rec : int
        the recording to look in
    samps : int
        the time to lock the spiketrain to in samples
    clu : int
        the cluster identifier to get spikes from
    spikes : pandas dataframe
        the pandas dataframe containing spikes (see core)
    window : tuple or list of floats
        the window around the event in seconds to sample spikes
    fs : float
        sampling rate of the recording
